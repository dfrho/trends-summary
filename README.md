## Current Architecture

The current architecture of Search by State Trends is designed for simplicity and real-time data processing:

1. **Data Fetching**: The application fetches real-time data from the Google Trends RSS feed for each selected state.

2. **State Selection**: Users interact with an interactive US map to select a state of interest.

3. **Trend Processing**: When a state is selected, the backend processes the RSS feed data to extract relevant trend information.

4. **AI Summary Generation**: The extracted trend data is sent to OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, which generates a concise summary of the trending topics.

5. **Display**: The frontend displays both the raw trend data and the AI-generated summary to the user.

This architecture allows for quick, on-demand access to current trend data without the need for a persistent database or complex data storage solutions...or competing directly with Google. Because it's just a hobby project...Google üòÅ.
